                    Thank you very much for providing some of the initial information required by applicants looking to
                    become licensed foster or foster-to-adopt parents in New Hampshire. Submitting this information is one
                    part of the process and does not require a commitment from you to follow through with licensing. You
                    will be asked to participate in foster and adoptive parent training. Your residence will need to be
                    inspected for safety and you will have various record checks and will be interviewed several times as
                    part of this process. Each applicant is allowed to set the pace of this process and may withdraw or
                    place themselves on hold at any time. Opening your heart and home to a child in need, whether for a few
                    days or forever, will change your life and the life of a child. Only you will know if this is the right
                    time for you and your family to begin that journey.
                </p>
