            Note on Submission Timeline
        </h2>
        <ul class="note__list">
            <li>Districts that submit near the due date should expect to wait a few weeks for review. Districts that submit early may see a shorter turnaround. </li>
            <li>The start date for each grant is the date on which the district submits substantially approvable information and budget for that grant.  For example, if the completed consolidated ESSA application is submitted on August 15 and all grant information but that for Title III, Part A is substantially approvable, the start date for all grants but Title III, Part A will be August 15.  The start date for Title III, Part A will be the date on which any deficiency for that grant has been cured and it becomes substantially approvable.  However, no grant funds for any ESSA grant will be issued until all of the grants contained within this consolidated ESSA application have been approved. </li>
            <li>Districts that fail to file by September 13, 2019 will receive last priority for review.  </li>
            <li> Expenses incurred prior to approval of a district's consolidated application and start date(s) are not payable with grant funds!</li>
            <li> Responding quickly to requests for information can result in an earlier approval of your grant application. </li>
            <li> Grant payment notices will be available in this system after the grant application has been approved and the initial payment is processed.</li>
