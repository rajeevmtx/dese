        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Department) is required under M.G.L. c. 71B, &sect;10 to review special education programs in approved special education schools that serve publicly funded students under the provisions of Board of Elementary and Secondary Education Regulations 603 CMR 28.00 and 18.00. Each year, the Department's Office of Approved Special Education Schools (OASES) conducts onsite visits to selected approved special education school programs to verify the implementation of these programs. The selected schools for the 2019-2020 review cycle were notified in February 2019 of scheduled visits and were required to conduct a Self-Assessment using the Department's web-based monitoring system (WBMS) before the arrival of the Department's visiting team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statewide six-year Approved Special Education School Program Review cycle together with the Department&rsquo;s Mid-cycle monitoring schedule is posted on the Department&rsquo;s web site at http://www.doe.mass.edu/pqa/review/psr/6yrcycle.html.</span></p>
