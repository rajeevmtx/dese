                    New York State has established COVID-19 testing sites for high risk populations to be tested. Please fill out the brief questionnaire and as testing becomes available in your area you will be contacted and scheduled at a testing site. Please note, New York State is prioritizing testing for symptomatic health care workers, individuals associated with a nursing home and adult care facilities and those who have been in close contact with a confirmed positive case. For more information regarding COVID-19 please visit <a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home">https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home</a>.
